      <h3>
        This is a simple HTML webpage that represents the meeting minutes for a
        sample team. Meeting minutes are notes recording during a meeting so
        that anyone who missed the meeting can easily catch up, or if someone
        needs to reference back to a meeting that happened a little while ago
        they can job their memory.

          <b>Agenda:</b> Our company would like us to role out a new marketing
          campaign for our new product. We need to come up with a name for the

          how we are going to market the product. We need to come up with a plan
          for how we are going to advertise it effectively. This includes
          identifying target demographics, selecting appropriate advertising

          <b>Agenda:</b> The team is meeting to discuss the marketing campaign

            As per <strong>Bob's</strong> suggestion, we are going to have a
            booth at the local farmer's market. In order to have a good idea of
            what local farmer's markets to go to, <strong>MacKenzie</strong> is
            going to do some research on local farmer's markets in the area.
